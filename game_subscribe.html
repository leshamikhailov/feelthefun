      Hello, we are a team of three: a psychologist, a programmer and an illustrator, who decided to create a games for mobile devices.<br><br>
      We want our games not only to make a child happy, but also contribute to their development. Our psychologist Natalia has a great experience in working with toys. She is an expert, who estimates their quality and development potential.

 	  <p>
      This attractive and cheerful game is intended for children ages 2 – 4.<br>
      Playing this game, a child will have a possibility to get acquainted with distinctive features of different animals, as there are few opportunities to do so for little urban citizen.
The game is based on the following principles:<br><br>
First, a child should be active while playing, in other words to use their imagination and knowledge.<br><br>
Second, a computer game should not distract a child from reality, on the contrary, it should broaden their world concept, appeal to their experience.<br><br>
Third, games and toys should be attractive, develop child’s color taste, that is why we do not use colors, which are too bright and contrasting and exaggerated cartoon characters. Calming colors and delicate tone combinations will form a child’s conception of color nuances.<br><br>
Fourth, we encourage cooperation in a game. Our game is developed in such a way that allows a child to play it with coevals as well as with adults.<br><br>
And of course, the game should bring a pleasure to a child! That’s why we do everything to make it interesting.<br><br>
<b>We address the parents, who care about their child and think about his/her future.</b> Although a child can play our game independently, we remind you, that he/she learns everything by interacting with adults. That is why even if he plays the greatest games and with the best toys his achievements should be shared with adults. Only this way he will feel that he is skilled and believe in himself.<br><br>
Also, we believe that protecting the privacy of our children is the utmost importance. Please review our <a href="privacypolicy.html">privacy policy</a> to understand how and when we collect and use data.
